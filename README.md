# Open Contributions Logbook üìì

‚ö†Ô∏è No code or confidential information will ever be published here, **unless I am explicitly allowed to share it and/or it is already public**.

This repository is my personal logbook of open source practice and contributions.  
I use it to document my GitHub workflow (fork, branch, commit, pull request) and track my progress.

‚úÖ Created my first pull request to the Unreal Engine repository (Epic Games).  

Since the repository is private, no public link can be shared here.
